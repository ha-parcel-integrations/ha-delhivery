A custom Home Assistant integration that tracks your [Delhivery](https://www.delhivery.com) (India) parcels by AWB (waybill) number. No account is needed — you enter the tracking code yourself, just like on the Delhivery website.

> **Early release (0.9.x).** This integration ships on a keyless endpoint that is live-confirmed and control-tested. Since 2026-08-09 the payload's field names and status vocabularies are first-party — read straight out of Delhivery's own consignee app — but no real Delhivery AWB has ever actually been run through the endpoint, so those values are still unconfirmed on the wire. Every mapped status therefore still logs a self-reporting warning until real users' logs confirm it; see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).

Part of the [ha-parcel-integrations](https://github.com/ha-parcel-integrations) family: it publishes the same canonical parcel format, statuses and events as the other carrier integrations, so it plugs straight into the [Parcel Aggregator](https://github.com/ha-parcel-integrations/ha-parcel-aggregator) and cross-carrier automations.

## Features

- Track any number of Delhivery parcels by AWB (waybill) number — no account needed
- Per-parcel sensor with the canonical status (`registered` / `in_transit` / `out_for_delivery` / `delivered` / …) and the carrier's own status text
- Summary sensors: incoming parcels, next delivery, recently delivered parcels
- Read-only **Deliveries** calendar with the expected delivery date, when Delhivery reports one
- `delhivery.track_parcel` / `delhivery.untrack_parcel` services, so a dashboard button can add a parcel
- Events + device triggers for no-code automations (parcel registered, status changed, delivered, delivery time changed)
- Opt-in per-parcel status history, built from Delhivery's own scan events
- Manual refresh button and a diagnostic last-update sensor

## Requirements

- Home Assistant 2024.7 or newer
- A Delhivery parcel and its tracking code (from the shipping
  confirmation email or the missed-delivery card) — no account needed

## Installation

### HACS (recommended)

1. In HACS, choose the three-dot menu → **Custom repositories**.
2. Add `https://github.com/ha-parcel-integrations/ha-delhivery` as an **Integration**.
3. Install **Delhivery** and restart Home Assistant.

### Manual

Copy `custom_components/delhivery` into your `config/custom_components/` folder and restart Home Assistant.

## Configuration

Add the integration via **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration → Delhivery**. There is nothing to fill in: the hub is created immediately (Delhivery tracking needs no account).

Then add parcels via the integration's **Configure** dialog, the [`delhivery.track_parcel`](#services) service, or a [dashboard button](examples/dashboards/add_parcel_card.yaml). The tracking code is on your shipping confirmation email or the missed-delivery card.

## Options

Open **Configure** on the integration entry:

| Section | Option | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Parcels | Add / remove | — | Manage the tracked tracking codes. Changes apply immediately, no restart. |
| Delivered parcels | Filter by / amount | last 7 days | How long delivered parcels stay visible on the delivered sensor. |
| Parcel history | Include status history | off | Adds a `history` attribute per parcel with each status update. |
| Polling | Refresh every | 30 min | How often Delhivery is checked. Slower is gentler on their API. |

## Removal

Standard HA removal applies: **Settings → Devices & Services → Delhivery → ⋮ → Delete**. Nothing is stored on Delhivery's side.

## Sensors

| Entity | Description |
|---|---|
| `sensor.delhivery_incoming_parcels` | Number of active tracked parcels, full list under the `parcels` attribute |
| `sensor.delhivery_parcel_<code>` | One per tracked parcel; state is the canonical status, attributes carry the full normalised parcel |
| `sensor.delhivery_next_delivery` | Earliest expected delivery moment across all active parcels |
| `sensor.delhivery_delivered_parcels` | Recently delivered parcels (see the retention option) |
| `sensor.delhivery_last_successful_update` | Diagnostic: when Delhivery was last polled successfully |

A delivered parcel moves from its per-parcel sensor to the delivered sensor automatically.

## Parcel status reference

The `status` field is the carrier-agnostic enum shared by the whole integration family. Delhivery's own status strings (`hqStatus`, falling back to the `trackingStates` progress ladder) are mapped to all eight values below, but — since no real AWB has ever been run through the endpoint — every mapped status still logs a self-reporting warning until real users' logged reports confirm it against the live API.

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `registered` | Announced / received by Delhivery |
| `in_transit` | In the sorting network |
| `out_for_delivery` | With the courier today |
| `at_pickup_point` | Waiting for you at a pickup location |
| `delivered` | Delivered |
| `returning` | Going back to the sender |
| `problem` | Delhivery reports an exception |
| `unknown` | Not yet scanned, or a status we have not mapped yet |

The carrier's own human-readable text is always available as `raw_status`.

## Events

The integration fires these on the event bus (also available as device triggers on the Delhivery device):

| Event | When |
|---|---|
| `delhivery_parcel_registered` | A new parcel appears in the active list |
| `delhivery_parcel_status_changed` | A parcel's canonical status changes (`old_status` / `new_status` in the payload), except the final hop to delivered |
| `delhivery_parcel_delivered` | A parcel is delivered |
| `delhivery_parcel_delivery_time_changed` | The expected delivery window changes |

Every payload is the full normalised parcel plus the hub's `device_id`. Events are suppressed on the first refresh after start-up.

## Services

| Service | Fields | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `delhivery.track_parcel` | `tracking_code` | Start tracking a parcel |
| `delhivery.untrack_parcel` | `tracking_code` | Stop tracking a parcel |

## Examples

Ready-to-paste automations and dashboard snippets live in [`examples/`](examples/), including tracking a new parcel straight from a dashboard.

### Community Lovelace cards

Third-party cards that work with this integration's sensors:

- [jonisnet/hki-parcels-card](https://github.com/jonisnet/hki-parcels-card)
- [klaptafel/ha-package-tracker-card](https://github.com/klaptafel/ha-package-tracker-card)

## Debugging

```yaml
logger:
  logs:
    custom_components.delhivery: debug
```

## Troubleshooting

- **A log line says a status was "mapped to '...' — but ... this mapping is still ... not a confirmed value"** — this is expected and not an error: every one of Delhivery's known statuses is mapped, but none has ever been confirmed against a real, live response. Please [open an issue](https://github.com/ha-parcel-integrations/ha-delhivery/issues/new?template=unrecognised_status.yml) and paste the line, along with what the parcel was actually doing — that is exactly what turns "mapped but unconfirmed" into "confirmed".
- **A status logs "Unrecognised Delhivery status"** — please [open an issue](https://github.com/ha-parcel-integrations/ha-delhivery/issues/new?template=unrecognised_status.yml) with the logged line; this is exactly the report that grows the status map.
- **A log line starts with "First real Delhivery data\[\] entry ever captured"** — please open an issue and paste it. This is the single most useful report this integration can receive: it is (redacted, per the diagnostics rules) the first real payload shape anyone has ever seen from this endpoint.
- **A log line mentions "a shape we have never parsed"** (for `trackingStates`, `hqStatus`, or `scans`) — same as above, please share it; it tells us where the real payload diverges from the app's own field names so the mapping can be corrected instead of guessed.
- **A parcel never appears / stays on `unknown` forever** — Delhivery's own not-found response ("invalid AWB or very old package") looks identical to a not-yet-scanned parcel, so double-check the AWB is correct.

## Related integrations

This integration is part of [**ha-parcel-integrations**](https://github.com/ha-parcel-integrations) — a family of
parcel-carrier integrations that all publish the same canonical parcel format,
statuses and events.

- [**Parcel Aggregator**](https://github.com/ha-parcel-integrations/ha-parcel-aggregator) rolls every installed carrier
  up into one set of sensors.

This integration uses the same public tracking endpoint as the Delhivery consumer website. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or supported by Delhivery. Be gentle with the polling interval.
